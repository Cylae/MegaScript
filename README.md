# üöÄ GCP Mail & WordPress Server Setup Guide üöÄ

This guide provides all the necessary steps to deploy a full-featured mail server and a WordPress website on a single, cost-effective Google Cloud Platform (GCP) virtual machine.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

*   A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with billing enabled.
*   A registered domain name (e.g., `example.com`).
*   Access to your domain's DNS settings at your domain registrar.
*   (For Windows Users) [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) and PuTTYgen installed for SSH access.

## ‚ú® What You'll Deploy

*   **üì¨ A Complete Mail Server:** Using the robust and easy-to-manage [Mail-in-a-Box](https://mailinabox.email/) software, with its admin panel secured by an SSL certificate.
*   **üìù A WordPress Website:** The world's most popular content management system, also secured by an SSL certificate.
*   **üîó A URL Shortener:** Using the popular and lightweight [Yourls](https://yourls.org/) software.
*   **üîí Automatic Security:** The server will be configured with automatic security updates.
*   **üí∞ Cost-Effective:** All running on a single `e2-micro` VM instance that is eligible for the GCP Free Tier.

## üöÄ Part 4: Running the Setup Script

Once connected to your server via SSH, follow these steps:

1.  **Download the Scripts:**
    Download `setup-server.sh` and the other management scripts from the repository.
    ```bash
    # Example using wget - replace with the actual URL
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/path/to/repo/setup-server.sh
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/path/to/repo/config.ini.example
    # ... download other scripts as needed ...
    ```

2.  **Configure Your Setup:**
    The server setup is now controlled by a configuration file for safety and ease of use.
    *   First, copy the example config:
        ```bash
        cp config.ini.example config.ini
        ```
    *   Next, edit the `config.ini` file with your details:
        ```bash
        nano config.ini
        ```
    *   Fill in your `DOMAIN`, `EMAIL`, `TIMEZONE`, and other desired settings.

3.  **Make the Script Executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup-server.sh
    ```

4.  **Run the Setup:**
    Run the script with `sudo`. It will now present you with an interactive menu.
    ```bash
    sudo ./setup-server.sh
    ```
    From the menu, you can choose to run the full initial setup, install additional components like the URL shortener, or access the other management scripts.

---

## üéâ Part 5: Post-Installation Steps

The script automates most of the setup. At the end of the process, you will be shown your WordPress credentials.

1.  **Final DNS Configuration:** After the script finishes, log in to your Mail-in-a-Box admin panel at `https://box.yourdomain.com/admin`. Go to the "System > External DNS" page. You will find a list of DNS records you need to add at your domain registrar. This is crucial for your mail server to work correctly.
2.  **WordPress Finalization:** Navigate to `https://www.yourdomain.com` in your browser. Your site is already installed, so you can log in directly at `https://www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin` using the credentials provided at the end of the setup script.
3.  **Security Scan Review:** The script automatically runs a security scan with `Lynis` at the end of the installation. You can review the detailed report at `/var/log/lynis-report.dat` to see potential security hardening suggestions.
